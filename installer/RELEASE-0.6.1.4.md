Hosting works again on machines whose Windows lacks the ISRG Root X2 certificate

Everyone in a session needs this version, and the dedicated relay runs it.

How to install

Windows (Steam, game build 35924)
1. Download `TpF2Multiplayer.msi` below.
2. Close the game and run the MSI. It installs into the game folder and the mod into the game's mods.
3. Start the game: Main menu → Multiplayer. Installs of 0.5.7 or newer get this update offered in game; older ones install the MSI by hand.

Linux and Steam Deck (the Windows game under Proton)
1. In Steam, set Transport Fever 2 to run with Proton (Properties → Compatibility; Proton 9 or newer), start it once and quit.
2. Download `install_proton.sh` below, close the game, and run `sh install_proton.sh`. It finds Steam, the game and the Proton prefix, downloads `TpF2Multiplayer-files.zip` from this release, checks it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` and installs; `--dry-run` shows the plan first. It needs only bash, curl, sha256sum and unzip. (`install_proton.py` does the same with Python 3.9 or newer: `python3 install_proton.py`.)
3. Start the game: Main menu → Multiplayer. Full guide: docs/proton/INSTALL.md.

Manual install (any platform): `TpF2Multiplayer-files.zip` holds the files in the game-folder layout.

Fixes
- Hosting on some Windows machines failed silently: every call to the master server ended in "certificate has expired", so the lobby was never listed and never heard joiners knocking. The lobby now carries the ISRG root certificates itself, so it verifies the master on any machine.

Also in this line: 0.6.1.3 added the relay fallback for player-hosted games (the master server forwards a pair's sealed frames when the hole punch cannot work).
